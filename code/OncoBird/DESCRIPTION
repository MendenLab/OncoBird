Description: OncoBird identifies candidates for predictive biomarkers in oncology trials by 
    leveraging mutually exclusive somatic mutations in tumour subtypes for subgroup analysis. 
    It systematically screens for predictive effects of somatic alterations in pre-defined tumour subtypes. 
    It allows users to gain insights about the biomarker landscape in their trial 
    and explore putative cancer subtypes and how they may be leveraged for precision oncology. 
    In our manuscript, we showcased ONcoBird for a clinical trial for FOLFIRI plus either cetuximab and bevacizumab in metastatic colorectal cancer. 
    Here, we showcase OncoBird by using a publically available clinical trial for gefitinib in non-small cell lung cancer.
